  		<p>Iâ€™m a former educator in the process of making a career change into web development, anbd to that end, am presently enrolled at Prime Academy. The internship position at OpenSnow would be an excellent opportunity for me to further my education in this area while also gaining real-life experience in the working environment of this field. Previously a teacher of both mathematics and humanities, I have excellent communication and analytical skills, while also being both motivated and flexible.</p>
